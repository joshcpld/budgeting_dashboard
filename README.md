I completed this project to create a simple budgeting dashboard which allows the user to upload bank statements to determine if my spending is in line with the 50/25/25 (needs/wants/savings) personal finance rule (google the 50/20/30 rule if unfamiliar).

This dashboard allows the user to upload a bank statement, and from this it generates a graph summarising total income, as well as spending on needs, wants and savings. Black dots indicate this graph also indicate what spending ought to be to achieve my goal of spending 50% of my income on needs, and 25% on wants and savings respectively.

It also produces two tables summarising spending on needs and wants, which are presented in terms of the business where I spent money, or the category of spending (e.g. "Rent and Mortgage", "Restaurants and Cafes" or "Pubs and Bars").

There is also a "Data" tab showing the data you uploaded where you can also directly edit the data to address any errors that might be reflected in the chart/tables. These tables/chart reflect this edited data.

Currently, this dashboard only works using data available from Up Bank. Besides it being the bank I use for daily purchasing, Up is great a categorising spending at different businesses into the values seen in the "up_category" column of the "Data" tab. All this dashboard really does is identify which of them are needs, and assumes the rest are wants. Savings are determined by what's leftover from income after accounting for needs and wants spending.

If there is demand, I will consider developing some updates for data from other banks. However, this would only be feasible if the bank in question categorises spending data similarly to Up Bank.
